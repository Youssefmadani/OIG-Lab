# Access Certifications

The next capability we will explore is Access Certification. Access Certification (aka attestation, recertification etc.) is the mechanism to validate that a user still needs the access they have. It is a common control in compliance regulations. Certification campaigns may be run periodically, or there may be continuous certification when user roles change. Okta Identity Governance currently supports user-group memberships and user-application assignments. Participants in a campaign (such as the userâ€™s manager) will approve (access retained) or revoke access (access should be removed).
