# Okta Identity Governance - an Introduction

## Introduction

During the workshop we will attempt to familiarize you with Okta Identity Governance or OIG for short. Our IGA solution consists of three product parts. Okta Identity Governance, Okta Lifecycle management and Okta Workflows. We will mainly focus on OIG and time-permitting also go into Okta Workflows. We are assuming that participants are familiar with our automated provisioning capabilities and will just be working with dummy apps to showcase OIG functionality.

## Check if OIG is enabled for your tenant

Ensure that Okta Identity Governance is activated for your tenant by navigating to your tenant and navigating to the Admin Console. On the left side-bar you should see an item named Identity Governance. If not, reach out to your instructor and he/she should be able to activate it for you.

## Check if you have some dummy users / groups / applications

For the lab we will be leveraging the automatically created users, groups and applications. We won't configure the applications for SSO or provisioning but still need these resources to explain how access requests and certifications work in Okta Identity Governance(OIG).
